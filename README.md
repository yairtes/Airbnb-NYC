The data has few limitations<br/>
I examined the data base on 3 parameters:<br/>

Current -  Data is 2 years old and may be not relevant<br/>
Reliable - Not reliable as it only has data of New York<br/>

- The most significant number of units for rent is in Manhattan, and the lowest is in the Bronx.<br/>
