## :monocle_face: About The Analysis 

The short-term apartment rental market in New York is thriving. Mainly due to its central location, tourist attractions and business activity. Airbnb currently dominates the short-term apartment rental market with over 45,000 apartments in NYC alone. Therefore, the purpose of the current analysis is to find channels for investing in short-term rental apartments in NYC through Airbnb and to examine the investment's viability.

## 📚 About The Data
- Data from Kaggle with tranperent data on properties rented through Airbnb [link](https://bit.ly/3GKR5vB)
- 5 Datasets on New York City Home Sale Deals from the New York Treasury Department Website [link](https://on.nyc.gov/3FFMAkt) 
 
#### Limitations<br/>
I examined the data base on 3 parameters:<br/>
**Comprehensive** - Parameters match most of Airbnb parameters.<br/>
**Current** -  Data is 2 years old and may be not relevant.<br/>
**Reliable** - Not reliable as it only has data of New York.<br/>

## 💡 Insights

- Customers mostly prefer whole apartments or private rooms over shared rooms. 	and are also willing to pay for them.<br/>
- Despite the low demand, there is no significant difference in price between shared rooms and private rooms.<br/>
- As you get closer to downtown Manhattan, rental prices go up.<br/>
- The most significant number of units for rent is in Manhattan, and the lowest is in the Bronx.<br/>
